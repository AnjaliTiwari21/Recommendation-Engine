<h3>Approach:</h3> 
1. To design a database schema to store theunstructured data in the form of nodes and relation using cypher. 
2. To import the data into a jupyter environment for further exploring and analysing the data using exploratory data analysis, machine learning and natural language processing libraries to perform topic modelling on the textual data imported from the Neo4j. 
3. The topics generated in conjunction with textual data were then be imported back again to Neo4j to explore further insights about data.

<h3>Technology used: </h3>
**Database:** Neo4j
**Programming:** py2neo, nltk, sklearn, datetime, pandas, matplotlib, wordcloud, scipy, LDA
**Data Vizualization:** pyLDAvis, cypher
